# Image Style Transfer Project

This project implements neural style transfer, a technique that allows the artistic style of one image to be applied to another image while preserving its content. The project includes code for training style transfer models, performing style transfer on images, and providing a web interface for users to interact with the style transfer application.

## Directory Structure

- **Image_style_transfer**: This directory contains subdirectories for storing images used for style transfer. The `art` directory contains images of artwork, and the `train` directory contains images used for training the style transfer model.
  
- **__pycache__**: This directory contains compiled Python bytecode files generated by the Python interpreter. These files are created to speed up the execution of Python programs.

- **app.py**: This is the main Python script for running the style transfer application. It provides a web interface for users to upload images and apply style transfer.

- **data**: This directory contains various data files related to the project, including original images, output images, and trained style transfer models.

- **docs**: This directory contains documentation files related to the project, such as PDF documents summarizing the project or its results.

- **model.ipynb**: This is a Jupyter Notebook containing code for training or evaluating the style transfer model.

- **nst.py**: This Python script contains code for performing neural style transfer using pre-trained models.

- **output.jpg**: This file is an output image generated by the style transfer process.

- **templates**: This directory contains HTML templates for the web interface of the style transfer application, including an index HTML file, a CSS file for styling, and an output image file.

- **transformer_net.py**: This Python script contains the implementation of the transformer network used in the style transfer model.

- **utils.py**: This Python script contains utility functions or helper functions used in the project.

- **vgg.py**: This Python script contains the implementation of the VGG network used in the style transfer model.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the `app.py` script to start the style transfer application.

3. Upload an image and select a style to apply style transfer. The application will generate the styled image and display it in the web interface.
